In this notebook we will build a classifier that takes an image of a handwritten digit and outputs a label 0-9. We will look at a particularly simple strategy for this problem known as the nearest neighbor classifier.
Nearest neighbor for handwritten digit recognition
In the notebook it is clearly explained..
